219. Contains Duplicate II
Array, Hash Table

Description:
Given an array of integers and an integer k, 
find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and 
the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false

        Method: Create three dictionaries.
                The 1st one contains the characters have been seen.
                The 2nd one contains those haven't.
                The 3rd one contans the difference of the indices of two seen characters.
                Loop through the list.
                If the char is not in eith of seen or unseen (first time encounter), we save it and its index to seen.
                If the char is in unseen and not in seen (second time encounter), we remove it from unseen and save it and its index to seen.
                  In the same time, we save the difference between the current index and the previous index to result.
                If the char is in seen (encounter it more than twice), compare the value saved in result and the difference between the current index and the previous index in seen.
                  If less than the value saved, update the result.
                At the end, remember to check the len(result.values()) in case there is no repeated char.
