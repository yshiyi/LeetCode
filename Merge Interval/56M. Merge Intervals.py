56. Merge Intervals

Description:
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, 
and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

# Solution
'''
Method: Sort the list according to the first element
        Put the first interval into the ans
        Compare the ending time of the last element in ans to the starting time of the next interval in intervals
          If overlapping, update the ending time of the last element in ans
          else put the interval into the ans
