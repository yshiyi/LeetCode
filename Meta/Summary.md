# Heap
## 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.\
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.\
Example 1:\
Input: nums = \[3,2,1,5,6,4\], k = 2\
Output: 5\
**Constraints:**\
1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104\
-104 <= nums\[i\] <= 104\
**Method:**\
Create a heap to store k element. Pop the top one when length of the heap is greater than k.\
Time complexity: O(Nlogk), using O(logk) to maintain the heap\
Space complexity: O(k)
```
class Solution(object):
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        h = []
        heapq.heapify(h)
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(h, num)
            if len(h)>k:
                heapq.heappop(h)
        return h[0]
```

## 347. Top K Frequent Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. \
You may return the answer in any order.\
Example 1:\
Input: nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\], k = 2\
Output: \[1,2\]\
**Constraints:**\
1 <= nums.length <= 105\
k is in the range \[1, the number of unique elements in the array\].\
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\
Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.\
**Method:**\
Use a Counter to count the frequency of each element. Then create a heap to store k elements.\
Each element in the heap is a tuple. The first entry is the frequency, and the second entry is the number.\
Time complexity: O(N+Mlogk), N is the total number of elements in nums, M is the number of elements in the dic.\
Space complexity: O(M), M is always greater than or equal to k.\
```
class Solution(object):
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        count = collections.Counter(nums)
        h = []
        heapq.heapify(h)
        for num in count.keys():
            heapq.heappush(h, (count[num], num))
            if len(h)>k:
                heapq.heappop(h)
        ans = []
        for frq, val in h:
            ans.append(val)
        return ans
```

## 23. Merge K Sorted Lists
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.\
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.\
Example 1:\
Input: lists = \[\[1,4,5\],\[1,3,4\],\[2,6\]\]\
Output: \[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6\]\
Explanation: The linked-lists are:\
\[1->4->5, 1->3->4, 2->6\]\
merging them into one sorted list:\
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6\
Example 2:\
Input: lists = \[\]\
Output: \[\]\
Example 3:\
Input: lists = \[\[\]\]\
Output: \[\]\
**Constraints:**\
k == lists.length\
0 <= k <= 104\
0 <= lists\[i\].length <= 500\
-104 <= lists\[i\]\[j\] <= 104\
lists\[i\] is sorted in ascending order.\
The sum of lists\[i\].length will not exceed 104.\
**Method:**\
Create a heap, and put all the first node and its value into the heap.\
While the heap is not empty, we pop the first element, create a new node, and move to the next.\
Time complexity: O(Nlogk), N is the total nodes in the whole list.\
Space complexity: O(N), create a new linked list.
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        """
        :type lists: List[ListNode]
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        h = []
        heapq.heapify(h)
        for list in lists:
            if list is not None:
                heapq.heappush(h, (list.val, list))
        head = ListNode()
        cur = head
        while len(h):
            val, node = heapq.heappop(h)
            cur.next = ListNode(val)
            cur = cur.next
            if node.next is not None:
                node = node.next
                heapq.heappush(h, (node.val, node))
        return head.next
```

## 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, 
return the kth smallest element in the matrix.\
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.\
You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).\ 
Example 1:\
Input: matrix = \[\[1,5,9\],\[10,11,13\],\[12,13,15\]\], k = 8\
Output: 13\
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are \[1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15\], and the 8th smallest number is 13\
Constraints:\
n == matrix.length == matrix\[i\].length\
1 <= n <= 300\
-109 <= matrix\[i\]\[j\] <= 109\
All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.\
1 <= k <= n2\
**Follow up:**\
Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., O(1) memory complexity)?\
Could you solve the problem in O(n) time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading this paper fun.\
Time complexity: O(klogk), we only need to run k times.\
Space complexity: O(k), space for the heap
```
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        r, c = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        h = []
        heapq.heapify(h)
        for i in range(min(r, k)):
            heapq.heappush(h, (matrix[i][0], i, 0))
        
        ans = -1
        for i in range(k):
            ans, row, col = heapq.heappop(h)
            if col+1<c:
                heapq.heappush(h, (matrix[row][col+1], row, col+1))
        return ans
```

## 973. K Closest Points to Origin
Given an array of points where points\[i\] = \[xi, yi\] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, \
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).\
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\
Example 1:\
Input: points = \[\[1,3\],\[-2,2\]\], k = 1\ 
Output: \[\[-2,2\]\]\
Explanation:\
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just \[\[-2,2\]\].\
Constraints:\
1 <= k <= points.length <= 104\
-104 < xi, yi < 104\
**Method:**\
Use max heap. Specifically, we save the negative distance into the heap.\
Time complexity: O(Nlogk)
Space complexity: O(k)
```
class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, k):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        h = []
        heapq.heapify(h)
        for point in points:
            dis = math.sqrt(point[0]**2 + point[1]**2)
            heapq.heappush(h, (-dis, point))
            if len(h)>k:
                heapq.heappop(h)
        ans = []
        while len(h):
            d, point = heapq.heappop(h)
            ans.append(point)
        return ans
```
