"""
Given number M and N intervals in the form [a, b] (inclusive) where for every interval -M <= a <= b <= M, create a program that returns a point where the maximum number of intervals overlap.

Example:

M: 10
N: 4
Intervals:
[-3, 5]
[0, 2]
[8, 10]
[6, 7]
A correct answer would be either 0 ,1 or 2 since those points are found where 2 intervals overlap and 2 is the maximum number of overlapping intervals.
