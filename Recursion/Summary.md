# 1. Introduction to Recursion
A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
1. A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
